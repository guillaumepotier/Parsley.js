#Parsley.js

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/guillaumepotier/Parsley.js.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/guillaumepotier/Parsley.js)

Javascript form validation, without actually writing a single line of javascript!

#TODOs

See TODO.md

#Version

1.1.6

# Browser compatibility

No idea yet.. You tell me !

#Install dependencies for documentation and tests

`bower install jquery`
`bower install bootstrap`

#Run tests

* In your browser: go to `tests/index.html`
* Headless tests: install mocha-phantomjs with npm: `npm install -g mocha-phantomjs` and then run `./bin/test-suite.sh`

#Make production minified versions

You'll need ruby, and Google Closure compiler: `gem install closure-compiler`. Then, just call:

`./bin/build.sh version` where version is the build release. eg: `./bin/build.sh 1.1.2`

They'll be created and dumped in the dist/ directory

#Contribute!

##Validators

Add new validators in `parsley.extend.js` and minify it. No validators will be allowed directly into parsley.js
(but great validators could move from extra to parsley ;))

##Localization

If file does not exist, create it into `Ã¬18n/` directory with same syntax as others.  
Reference file is French one! ;)

##Integrations

Create integration with other framework as a separate Github repo and send a pull request for including here.  
Some integrations are

* [Django](https://github.com/agiliq/django-parsley)

* add / update tests to test suite (tests/index.html / tests/tests.js)
